📊 A generation left behind. Their dreams on hold, their potential wasted. How did Australia's youth become lost in an unemployment crisis? The statistics tell the story in stark terms: one in five under 25 unemployed, double the general rate.  But behind the numbers are real people watching helplessly as their peers move forward while they remain stuck - left to wrestle alone with doubts, disappointments and dismay.

📈 The current rate stands at a daunting 8.1%, challenging Australia's commitment to UN Sustainable Development Goal 8.6. A call to substantially reduce youth unemployment remains unmet.

🌐 The workforce landscape for young Australians is concentrated in specific sectors, with the most common youth jobs in accommodation and food services with youth making up 48.8% and retail trade with 31.27 of all young workers. This concentration poses economic and structural challenges, limiting bargaining power, suppressing wage growth, and hindering skill development.

🌍 A deeper dive into the causes unveils the 'lump of labour' fallacy, a misguided notion blaming migrants for unemployment. Contrary to this fallacy, migration has been a stimulus for growth and job creation. Australia's economic success over the last 24 years is indebted to the hardworking ethos of a diverse pool of immigrants.

📉 The Beveridge Curve sheds light on the evolving dynamics of unemployment and job vacancy rates, indicating a growing mismatch post-COVID. Proactive measures are essential to align the skills of young jobseekers with available positions, emphasizing the need for structural reforms and targeted education improvements.
